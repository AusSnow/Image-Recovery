# Image-Recovery
This program accepts a memory card as input and dumps all image files starting with 000.jpg and incrementing through each image until none are left. Before being overwrote these images may still exist on the memory after being deleted and may be possible to retrieve.
# Usage
To run this file type ./recover in the command line followed by the name of the memory card. For example, a test memory card has been provided named card.raw. Run ./recover card.raw to retrieve the images in the test card.
